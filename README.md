## Film-Sage

# Motivation 
 
 Our motivation was to build a web based app to help users with a movie choice descision with their own text based input that will determine the emotional weight of their input and suggest some movies to watch! 

 We built the project to help with descision burnout in a fun way, while also providing links to other resources incase a user may need it. 
 
 # What we leared 
 
 Team coding, debugging, finding and using resources and the right kind of documentation. git hub workflow!!! How to parse information from an API to get the data we want. working together in an agile format to deliver our project. communicating to consolidate ideas between members. 

 What makes our project stand out is we are allowing open ended user input that determines emotional weight and outputs a emotion response to then search a movie database for suggestions to present to the user. 


# To the Future! 

Film Sage takes user input and outputs movies to watch based of emotional data determined from their input. 

We used Text to Emotion API (https://apilayer.com/marketplace/description/text_to_emotion-api) and TMBD Movie API (https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) for functionality on our app. 

challenges : Github workflow. Working within our knowledge set to get all our ideas translated was really difficult. 

We hope to implement a sortable favorites section. Favorite icon on the choosen movies. A more detailed search function that generates more personalized movie responses. Grow functionality to music, books, video games. 

# How to use the app!
